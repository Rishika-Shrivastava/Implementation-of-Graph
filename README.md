# Implementation-of-Graph

## Functionalities

1. Node operations: Add a node, Delete a node.
2. Edge operations: Add an edge, Delete an edge.
3. Displaying the graph via Depth First, Breadth First Traversals as well as Topological
Sort.
4. Detecting whether the graph is connected or disconnected.
5. Shortest path between a fixed source to all other vertices. Path as well as
path-cost is calculated.
6. Shortest path between any pair of nodes. Path as well as
path-cost is calculated.
7. Searching a value in the graph via breadth-first search and depth-first search.
8. Detecting presence of a cycle in the graph
9. Calculating and display the minimum spanning tree
10. Displaying all possible paths between a pair of nodes
